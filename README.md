# cmb-aber-dopp

The cmb-aber-dopp repository include all basic code to reproduce some Planck systematics as the Dipole Distortion (DD), simulate the Main Pipeline (MP) and Cros-check pipeline (CCP) (to generate aberrated, Doplered and boosted simulations here is used the Healpix Boost core - www.github.com/mquartin/healpix-boost) and estimate the ![\beta^A
](https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=%5Ctextstyle+%5Cbeta%5EA%0A),![\beta^A
](https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=%5Ctextstyle+%5Cbeta%5EA%0D) and ![\beta^A
](https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=%5Ctextstyle+%5Cbeta%5EA%0B) observables on Planck data. For the DD case the derivation of the equations are included. To cross-check Healpix Boost code (mainly when using polarization maps) and for fast tests, here it's included some python code for aberration and Doppler directly on pixel space.

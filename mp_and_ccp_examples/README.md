### Here is presented part of MP and CCP pipelines extracted as an example, but it can be easily extended to generate all needed simulations just by changing parameters. The [Healpix Boost](https://github.com/mquartin/healpix-boost) related codes are not presented here. All ideal simulations (without noise and mask) were generated with [Healpix Boost](https://github.com/mquartin/healpix-boost).
